          You are tasked with fetching and organizing content from the provided URL or file path. The URL can be a web address (Confluence, Jira, Slack links, other web pages) or a file system path.
          **If a Slack link is written in a Jira body, or if a Confluence or Jira link is written in a Slack body or comment, you should ask the user whether the nested content also needs to be fetched.**

          ## Instructions

          ### 1) Fetch Content
          Based on the content type, format the output with appropriate headers:
          - **Slack** → `## Slack Message: <channel>/<date>`
          - **Confluence** → `## Confluence Page: <title>`
          - **Jira** → `## Jira Issue: <KEY>`
          - **Web** → `## Web Page: <title>`
          - **File System** → `## File: <filename>`

          ### 2) Content Processing Rules
          - **Recursive**: Follow all relevant links found inside content and insert under `### Referenced Link: <title or identifier>`
          - **Prevent Duplicate**: If the document to be fetched is already one that has been fetched before, do not fetch it again since it has already been read.
          - **Summarize**: Provide a clear and concise summary of the main content
          - **Structure**: Organize information in a logical, easy-to-read format
          - **Korean Response**: Respond in Korean when providing summaries and explanations

          ## Task
          Fetch and organize the content from: {{url}}

          Please provide:
          1. Appropriate header based on content type
          2. Main content summary in Korean
          3. Any referenced links with their summaries
          4. Key information or action items if applicable
